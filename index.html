                  </span><br><br><br>

                  <b><span class="is-size-3">ABSTRACT:</span> </b>    In the dynamic era of modern transportation, the integration of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) – both aerial and terrestrial – with communication technology will reshape the mobility patterns. This workshop seeks to unravel the benefits and challenges of this convergence, where intelligent CAVs become an integral part of the networked ecosystem, enabling more intelligent and smart mobile systems.<br>
                  The workshop will explore the rise of assisted and automated transportation in the new Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) paradigm. Equipped with multiple Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) like high-definition cameras, radars and LiDARs, vehicles move in a coordinated and safe manner. Moreover, V2X signals are the key to facilitate seamless and instantaneous communication between vehicles and network infrastructure.<br>
                  Meanwhile, in the air, the complexities of aerial nodes, including coordinated Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) fleets and High-Altitude Platforms (HAP), exploit their roles as base stations and/or access points. We will investigate their integration into ground networks, exploring potential applications such as data traffic offloading and disaster relief efforts, as well as the challenges introduced by these energy-limited systems.
                  <br>The workshop will bring to light the technological advancements driving this transformation, exploring networking paradigms, signal processing techniques, and more. Through a blend of academic research and industry insights, we aim to chart a course towards safer, more intelligent, efficient, connected and autonomous transportation of moving elements.

              Catania is served by the <b>Fontanarossa International Airport</b> which is only a few miles away from the city center.<br>
              Buses leave the airport every 25 minutes to reach the city center and the train station (<a href="https://www.amts.ct.it/mappa-delle-linee?percorso=ALIBUS">https://www.amts.ct.it/mappa-delle-linee?percorso=ALIBUS</a>). Buses are available from 05:00 until midnight. This bus transport is provided by the AMT ‘Alibus’ service.<br>
              Take note that all bus tickets, once used, should be validated, or stamped. This is usually done by the validating machines near the entrance of the bus. The machine will put a stamp and a date on your ticket to show that it has been used. Passengers of the bus must validate their own tickets, as they are not validated by the driver of the bus.

            <p> <b>TITLE:</b> Integrating UAVs into 6G Networks: Opportunities and Challenges</p>
            <br>
            <p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> UAVs have shown great promise in many areas of socioeconomic impact. However, their wide adoption is still obstructed by a complicated regulatory environment and the unavailability of reliable connectivity, especially for Beyond Visual Line of Sight operation. In the current talk, we review the main opportunities ahd challenges, while integrating UAVs into 6G Networks. In addition, we present relevant research results and insights for two specific domains: 1) Mobile Edge Computing for UAV applications, 2) 3D Connectivity through Active Antenna Systems. Finally, a list of open research challenges is presented.</p>

            <p> <b>TITLE:</b> NTN and 3GPP Standards from 5G to 6G</p>
            <br>
            <p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> Prior to the advent of 5G, satellite and mobile networks were designed independently from one another and were addressing  separate user markets.
Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) are now part of 3GPP standards since Rel-17, providing seamless extended coverage to all 5G users. 6G will offer an opportunity to natively specify system architecture and protocols from the very beginning, enabling terrestrial and non-terrestrial network components to support a unified set of use cases.
We will briefly introduce industry standardization of NTN in 3GPP, reviewing current NTN features of 5G. We will then provide some initial considerations on 6G and how NTN can be a native part of it, specifically focusing on radio access network architecture.</p>

            <br>
            <p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> High Altitude Platforms (HAPS) equipped with base stations have recently been considered a promising aerial network component to support Radio Access Networks. They are typically envisioned as a means to extend radio coverage to remote areas or provide connectivity in case of a disaster. In this presentation, we take a different perspective and consider HAPS as elements that can increase network sustainability in two ways: first, they help operate the radio access network in a more energy-efficient manner; second, they reduce the need for network densification.</p>

            <p> <b>TITLE:</b> Open Connected Vehicles: Frameworks for Simulation and Field Trials</p>
            <br>
            <p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> Vehicular networks (also known as "Vehicle-to-Everything", V2X) represent one of the most impacting technological advances for the next generation of vehicles, that are going to be characterized by increasing levels of automation.
Connecting vehicles and allowing them to exchange data with other road users or with the infrastructure faces several challenges. In this context, open platforms assume a pivotal role both for research and industry since they enable the reproducibility of results, they provide transparency, reliability and community support, and they are a low-cost and effective way of researching new protocols and services.
In this talk, we will first understand why open source is important in the context of V2X research and deployment. We will then present an open simulation and emulation framework, called ms-van3t, for advanced research and simulation of V2X scenarios. The talk will include the presentation of the framework and a set of application-layer and network-layer results to showcase the capabilities of ms-van3t.
Since simulations may not be enough when testing a novel protocol or service for automotive applications, field tests play a fundamental role in studying the behavior of a V2X system in real-world scenarios. Motivated by this, we will present the DriveX On-Board Unit (OBU) and OScar (Open Stack for car), a cost-effective combination of customizable hardware (DriveX OBU) and open source software (OScar) to enable research on V2X by equipping existing vehicles, in a plug-and-play manner, with V2X communication technologies and a full ETSI C-ITS stack.
Finally, we will showcase LaTe, a lightweight latency measurement tool.</p>

            <p> <b>TITLE:</b> Robo-driver: the enabler of the revolution of personal mobility</p>
            <br>
            <p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> In the next 30 years a revolution is expected in the mobility model: the traditional personal mobility model (based on big, fossil-fuel-powered, personal-ownership cars) will be almost entirely replaced by Mobility-As-A-Service, autonomous, electric/H2 cars. This “revolution” aims to make a quantum leap in the overall efficiency of the mobility system, and to contribute to the improvement of the safety and sustainability of vehicles. This revolution will also deeply affect the structure of the entire automotive industry (layers, players, etc.)
Among the main technology megatrends, the autonomous-driving technology has a special/key role: not only is (by far) the most challenging from a technical point of view, but it will play the role of booster/catalyzer of all the other megatrends.
The plenary speech aims to provide a high-level view of this technology revolution, highlighting the role and the impact of the autonomous-driving technology.</p>

            <p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> Abstract: The speech will delve into the LINKS Foundation’s research activities in the realm of Connected, Cooperative, and Automated Mobility (CCAM), highlighting cutting-edge solutions that leverage Road Side Units (RSUs). These units, equipped with camera and LiDAR , facilitate a myriad of functions, from traffic management to enhancing road safety.
In this presentation, we will explore the pivotal role of RSUs equipped with advanced sensors and V2X communication capabilities in managing the transition towards fully connected vehicular networks. The focus will be on how RSUs communicate with connected vehicles, while simultaneously processing data from sensors about non-connected vehicles but also VRUs (Vulnerable Road Users - like pedestrian, bicycles, etc…) to create a Digital Twin of a road section. This capability is essential for the transition phase, ensuring that all vehicles and VRUs, regardless of their connectivity status, can coexist safely and efficiently on our roads.
Finally, we will explore the evolution of 5G towards smart, flexible, and context-aware networks that will support CCAM applications in the context of the ENVELOPE European project.</p>

            <p> <b>ABSTRACT:</b> The automotive industry is undergoing a transformative shift with the transition to software-defined vehicles (SDVs), effectively turning cars into sophisticated "computers on wheels." This paradigm shift places software at the forefront, enabling a myriad of features and capabilities within connected and autonomous vehicles. However, this software-centric approach introduces a spectrum of new challenges that necessitate a comprehensive assessment and a fundamental rethinking of our solution development strategies.
As vehicles become increasingly connected, the demand for advanced Automotive System-On-Chips (SoCs) escalates. These SoCs must keep pace with the evolution in connectivity and networking, accommodating the need for substantial data throughput. Concurrently, the increasing number of connections amplifies the risk of cyber-attacks, highlighting the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures.
Moreover, the safety-critical functions intrinsic to autonomous driving require real-time execution without interference from non-critical tasks. This necessitates a new breed of microcontrollers that can ensure the highest levels of safety and reliability. Enter the Stellar Integration Automotive Microcontrollers (MCUs)—a new family of microcontrollers engineered to fulfill the stringent demands of digital transformation and the shift towards SDVs.
